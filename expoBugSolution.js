//This file represents a potential solution, but it's likely not the solution for all cases of the error given its nondeterministic nature.
//Instead of a specific code fix, we need to focus on robust debugging techniques

//Steps to improve debugging:

//1. Add extensive console logs in critical areas of your app.
//2. Use Expo's debugging tools effectively.
//3. Try to isolate the problem by reducing the amount of code involved.
//4. If the problem remains, seek help in forums or online communities, providing detailed information about the crash.

//Example of added logging:

//function myFunction(){
// console.log('Entering myFunction');
// //... your code
// console.log('Exiting myFunction');
//}
